# Setting the Scene

Human mobility, the movement of human beings in space and time, reflects the spatial-temporal characteristics of human behavior. With the advancement of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) especially smart phone, a large volume of data related to human mobility have been collected. By using appropriate GIS analysis methods, these data are potentially useful in supporting smart city planning and management.

In Singapore, one of the important source of data related to human mobility is from [Land Transport Authority (LTA) DataMall](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en.html). Two data sets related to human mobility are provided by the portal, they are: Passenger Volume by Origin Destination Train Stations and Passenger Volume by Origin Destination Bus Stops. One of the limitation of these data sets is that their location are biased to either bus stops or MRT/LRT stations. In 2020, another very interesting human mobility data set called [Grab Posisi](https://engineering.grab.com/grab-posisi) was released by GRAB, one of the largest shared taxi operator in South-east Asia. There are two data sets been released and one of them is for Singapore.

# Objectives

Geospatial analytics hold tremendous potential to address complex problems facing society. In this study, you are tasked to apply appropriate spatial point patterns analysis methods to discover the geographical and spatio-temporal distribution of Grab hailing services locations in Singapore.

# The Task

-   Using appropriate function of **sf** and **tidyverse**, preparing the following geospatial data layer in sf tibble data.frames:

    -   Grab taxi location points either by origins or destinations.

    -   Road layer within Singapore excluding outer islands.

    -   Singapore boundary layer excluding outer islands.

-   Using the extracted data, derive traditional Kernel Density Estimation layers

-   Using the extracted data, derive either Network Kernel Density Estimation (NKDE) or Temporal Network Kernel Density Estimation (TNKD)

-   Using appropriate **tmap** function, display the kernel density layers on OpenStreetMap of Singapore

-   Describe the spatial patterns revealed by the kernel density maps.

# The Data

## Aspatial data

For the purpose of this assignment, [Grab-Posisi](https://engineering.grab.com/grab-posisi) of Singapore will be used

## Geospatial data

-   Road data set from OpenStreetMap of [Geofabrik download server](https://download.geofabrik.de/). The Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei coverage should be downloaded.

-   Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea) from Data.gov.sg

# Installing and Loading the R packages

```{r}
pacman::p_load(maptools, sf, raster, spatstat, tmap, tidyverse, arrow)
```

# Spatial Data Wrangling

## Importing Grab-Posisi Dataset

Since the dataset is stored as .parquet file format, we need to use the arrow package

```{r}
grab_data <- arrow::open_dataset("../../data/aspatial/GrabPosisi") %>%
  collect()
```

Let's convert the pingtimestamp column from integer to a datetime format

```{r}
grab_data$pingtimestamp <- as_datetime(grab_data$pingtimestamp)
```

## Extracting trip starting locations

```{r}
origin_df <- grab_data %>%
  group_by(trj_id) %>%
  arrange(pingtimestamp) %>% # from dplyr package
  filter(row_number()==1) %>%
  mutate(weekday = wday(pingtimestamp, # functions from lubridate package
                        label=TRUE,
                        abbr=TRUE),
         start_hr = factor(hour(pingtimestamp)), # With factor(), it makes it ordinal
         day = factor(mday(pingtimestamp)))
view(origin_df)
```

## Converting into sf tibble dataframe

Let's convert it into a sf tibble dataframe. According to the data source, our data is in Geodetic CRS: WGS84, so we need to convert it to SVY21 too.

```{r}
origin_sf <- st_as_sf(origin_df, coords = c("rawlng", "rawlat"), crs = 4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs=3414)
```

```{r}
st_geometry(origin_sf)
```

```{r}
write_rds(origin_sf,"../../data/rds/Take-home_Ex01/origin_sf.rds")
```

## Importing the Geospatial data

### Importing the Boundary of Singapore

```{r}
mpsz_sf <- st_read(dsn ="../../data/geospatial/MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL", layer = "MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL") %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)

sg_sf <- st_union(mpsz_sf)

plot(sg_sf)
```

```{r}
st_geometry(sg_sf)
```

### Importing Road data from OpenStreetMap

We have the ESRI files downloaded, so let's check what layers we can choose from this dataset.

```{r}
file_path = "../../data/geospatial/malaysia-singapore-brunei.shp"
layers <- st_layers(file_path)
print(layers)
```

We only want the data for roads, so let's pick the `gis_osm_roads_free_1` layer.

```{r}
MySgBr_Roads <- st_read(dsn ="../../data/geospatial/malaysia-singapore-brunei.shp", layer = "gis_osm_roads_free_1")
```

We notice that the **`MySgBr_Roads`** data is in Geodetic CRS: WGS 84 format, let's convert it to SVY21.

```{r}
MySgBr_Roads_SVY21 <- st_transform(MySgBr_Roads, crs = 3414)
```

```{r}
st_geometry(MySgBr_Roads_SVY21)
```

Now that the data is in SVY21 format, let's extract only the roads in Singapore using the Singapore boundary data.

```{r}
indices <- st_intersects(sg_sf, MySgBr_Roads_SVY21)
```

```{r}
sg_roads <- MySgBr_Roads_SVY21[unlist(indices), ]

```

```{r}
st_geometry(sg_roads)
```

```{r}
write_rds(sg_roads, "../../data/rds/Take-home_Ex01/sg_roads.rds")
```

```{r}
sg_roads <- read_rds("../../data/rds/sg_roads.rds")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = sg_roads) +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Roads in Singapore", 
       x = "Longitude", 
       y = "Latitude")
```

```{r}
# Set tmap mode to view for interactive maps
tmap_mode("view")

# Create interactive map
tm <- tm_shape(sg_roads) +
      tm_lines(col = "blue") +
      tm_basemap(server = "OpenStreetMap") +
      tm_layout(title = "Interactive Map of Roads in Singapore")

# Render the map
tm
```

# Geospatial Data Wrangling

## Creating `ppp` object

**spatstat** requires the analytical data in `ppp` object form. Let's convert our grab_sf into a `ppp` object.

```{r}
origin_ppp <- as.ppp(origin_sf)
```

Now, we will display the properties of our new `ppp` object.

```{r}
summary(origin_ppp)
```

```{r}
write_rds(origin_ppp, "../../data/rds/Take-home_Ex01/origin_ppp.rds")
```

## Creating `owin` object

It is good practice to confine the analysis within a geographical area like Singapore's boundaries. In **spatstat**, we can use the `owin` object to represent this polygonal region.

```{r}
sg_owin <- as.owin(sg_sf)
```

```{r}
summary(sg_owin)
```

## Combining point events object and `owin` object

```{r}
originSG_ppp = origin_ppp[sg_owin]
```

```{r}
summary(originSG_ppp)
```

# First Order Spatial Point Patterns Analysis

## Kernel Density Estimation

```{r}
kde_originSG_bw <- density(originSG_ppp,
                           sigma=bw.diggle,
                           edge=TRUE,
                           kernel="gaussian")
```

```{r}
plot(kde_originSG_bw)
```

```{r}
bw <- bw.diggle(originSG_ppp)
bw
```

## Re-scalling KDE Values

In the code below, we will re-scale the unit of measurement from meter to kilometer

```{r}
originSG_ppp.km <- rescale(originSG_ppp,1000,'km')
```

```{r}
kde_originSG.bw <- density(originSG_ppp.km,
                           sigma=bw.diggle,
                           edge=TRUE,
                           kernel="quartic")
plot(kde_originSG.bw)
```
